# TODO List for TLS Scanner Portal

## ✅ Completed (as of 2025-07-26)

### Core Scanner
- [x] Built fast Go-based TLS scanner (<1s scan times)
- [x] Protocol detection (TLS 1.0 - 1.3)
- [x] Cipher suite enumeration with security evaluation
- [x] Certificate validation and chain analysis
- [x] SSL Labs grading methodology implementation
- [x] Grade capping rules (TLS 1.0→C, 3DES→B, RC4→F, no PFS→B)
- [x] TLS 1.3 forward secrecy detection fix
- [x] Grade degradation tracking (shows specific issues)
- [x] Dual grading system (SSL Labs overall + subcategories)
- [x] Handle IP scanning properly
- [x] JSON and text output formats
- [x] Support for non-standard ports

### Web Portal Infrastructure
- [x] REST API with Gin framework
- [x] PostgreSQL database schema with SSL Labs fields
- [x] Redis job queue integration
- [x] Worker pool for concurrent scanning
- [x] WebSocket support for real-time updates
- [x] Docker Compose setup (ports 3000/8000)
- [x] Basic web UI with grade display

### Database & API
- [x] Enhanced database schema with security issue tracking
- [x] Certificate details storage (expiration, issuer, key info)
- [x] Dedicated tables for vulnerabilities and grade degradations
- [x] Weak protocol and cipher tracking tables
- [x] API worker saves all security issues
- [x] getScan endpoint returns complete security assessment
- [x] Database cleanup scripts (Docker-based, reads from .env)

### Web UI
- [x] Professional redesign with dark theme
- [x] SSL Labs score breakdown with visual progress bars
- [x] Security issues section with remediation guidance
- [x] Certificate expiration warnings (expired/critical/warning)
- [x] Recent Scans section with full scan history
- [x] Click-to-view previous scan results
- [x] Unique scan ID display
- [x] Weak protocols and cipher suites display
- [x] Real-time updates via WebSocket
