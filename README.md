Lightning-fast TLS/SSL security scanner with web UI. Get comprehensive security analysis in seconds, not minutes.

## Background

This project began as a learning exercise to explore Claude Code's capabilities and gain hands-on experience with Go. What started as a simple goal to build a faster TLS scanner for security testing quickly evolved into something more comprehensive.

The traditional bash-based TLS scanners were painfully slow, often taking minutes to complete basic scans. Security teams need tools that match the pace of modern development - fast, API-driven, and deployable anywhere. This scanner delivers sub-second results while providing deeper analysis than most alternatives.

Built with modern security teams in mind, TLS Scanner Portal offers:
- **Speed**: Faster than traditional scanners - get results in milliseconds, not minutes
- **Depth**: Enhanced vulnerability detection using zcrypto for research-grade analysis
- **Integration**: REST API and WebSocket support for seamless automation
- **Deployment**: Docker-based architecture runs anywhere your infrastructure lives

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Notice

**This tool uses zcrypto, a research-focused library that intentionally disables security features.**

**DO NOT use this codebase for:**
- ‚ùå **Actual TLS communications or connections**
- ‚ùå **Building production services that handle TLS**
- ‚ùå **Any purpose requiring cryptographic security**

The zcrypto library has safety features removed to enable testing of broken, obsolete, and insecure TLS configurations. This makes it perfect for security scanning but completely unsuitable for secure communications.

## Important: Defensive Security Only

This tool is designed exclusively for:
- ‚úÖ Security compliance scanning
- ‚úÖ Internal infrastructure auditing  
- ‚úÖ Identifying misconfigurations before attackers do
- ‚úÖ Monitoring certificate health and expiration

**DO NOT** use this tool for:
- ‚ùå Scanning infrastructure you don't own or have permission to test
- ‚ùå Exploiting discovered vulnerabilities
- ‚ùå Any malicious or unauthorized purposes

This is a defensive security tool - think "security team's best friend", not "scriptkiddie toyz".

## Basic Usage

### Web Portal
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and enter any hostname:
- `example.com` - Standard HTTPS scan
- `smtp.gmail.com:587` - SMTP with STARTTLS
- `192.168.1.1` - Internal IP addresses

### Command Line
```bash
# Basic scan
./tlsscanner -target example.com
./tlsscanner -target 192.168.1.1:8443

# JSON output (works with any host:port)
./tlsscanner -target smtp.gmail.com:587 -json

# With custom CA certificates (for internal/corporate CAs)
./tlsscanner -target internal.company.com -ca-path /path/to/ca/certs

# Deep scan including SSL v3 detection (slower)
./tlsscanner -target legacy.server.com -check-sslv3

# Batch scanning from CSV file
./tlsscanner -batch test/test-targets.csv
./tlsscanner -b test/test-targets.csv -summary  # Summary only
./tlsscanner -batch test/test-targets.csv -json > results.json
```

#### Batch File Format
```csv
# test/test-targets.csv - with header
target,check_sslv3,comments
google.com,N,Google main site
badssl.com,N,Testing site
expired.badssl.com,N,Expired cert test
self-signed.badssl.com,Y,Self-signed with SSL v3 check
smtp.gmail.com:587,N,Gmail SMTP with STARTTLS
smtp.gmail.com:465,N,Gmail SMTP with direct TLS

# Or minimal format (no header)
example.com
smtp.server.com:587
192.168.1.1:8443,Y
```

The scanner automatically detects STARTTLS for mail ports and trusts certificates signed by CAs in the specified directory.
