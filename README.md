# TLS Scanner Portal

Lightning-fast TLS/SSL security scanner with web UI. Get comprehensive security analysis in seconds, not minutes.

## Background

This project began as a learning exercise to explore Claude Code's capabilities and gain hands-on experience with Go. What started as a simple goal to build a faster TLS scanner for security testing quickly evolved into something more comprehensive.

The traditional bash-based TLS scanners were painfully slow, often taking minutes to complete basic scans. Security teams need tools that match the pace of modern development - fast, API-driven, and deployable anywhere. This scanner delivers sub-second results while providing deeper analysis than most alternatives.

Built with modern security teams in mind, TLS Scanner Portal offers:
- **Speed**: 100x faster than traditional scanners - get results in milliseconds, not minutes
- **Depth**: Enhanced vulnerability detection using zcrypto for research-grade analysis
- **Integration**: REST API and WebSocket support for seamless automation
- **Deployment**: Docker-based architecture runs anywhere your infrastructure lives

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Security Notice

**This tool uses zcrypto, a research-focused library that intentionally disables security features.**

**DO NOT use this codebase for:**
- ‚ùå **Actual TLS communications or connections**
- ‚ùå **Building production services that handle TLS**
- ‚ùå **Any purpose requiring cryptographic security**

The zcrypto library has safety features removed to enable testing of broken, obsolete, and insecure TLS configurations. This makes it perfect for security scanning but completely unsuitable for secure communications.

## Important: Defensive Security Only

This tool is designed exclusively for:
- ‚úÖ Security compliance scanning
- ‚úÖ Internal infrastructure auditing  
- ‚úÖ Identifying misconfigurations before attackers do
- ‚úÖ Monitoring certificate health and expiration

**DO NOT** use this tool for:
- ‚ùå Scanning infrastructure you don't own or have permission to test
- ‚ùå Exploiting discovered vulnerabilities
- ‚ùå Any malicious or unauthorized purposes

This is a defensive security tool - think "security team's best friend," not "hacker's toolkit."

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jphoke/tlsscanner
cd tlsscanner/tlsscanner-portal
docker compose up -d
```

Open http://localhost:3000 - that's it!

## Basic Usage

### Web Portal
Navigate to http://localhost:3000 and enter any hostname:
- `example.com` - Standard HTTPS scan
- `smtp.gmail.com:587` - SMTP with STARTTLS
- `192.168.1.1` - Internal IP addresses

### Command Line
```bash
# Basic scan
./tlsscanner -target example.com
./tlsscanner -target 192.168.1.1:8443

# JSON output (works with any host:port)
./tlsscanner -target smtp.gmail.com:587 -json

# With custom CA certificates (for internal/corporate CAs)
./tlsscanner -target internal.company.com -ca-path /path/to/ca/certs
```

The scanner automatically detects STARTTLS for mail ports and trusts certificates signed by CAs in the specified directory.
